    <div class="INTRO">
        <p>This project is a compilation of personal photos taken by the artist, personal photos taken by the artist’s connections, a representational map of where the photos have been taken, and snippets of interviews the artist will conduct with each connection.</p>
        <p>This project is meant to highlight the artist’s Native American heritage, along with their community. The photographs provided will showcase where the community “takes space”, which can include homes, office space, or even a public location if they so choose.</p>
        <p>Nature of the interviews: The interviews will be short, with proposed questions below:
            Why did you choose to share this photo?
            How do you take space in this given setting?
            Do you feel like you are connected with your community, or do you feel like there could be more spaces to be occupied?
            What is your hope for this project?
        </p>
        <p>The map will be provided to showcase how far and wide the artist and their connections are spread out. This will not give precise locations to provide privacy to the artist and connections, but will generate “hotspots” on a standard map of the United States.</p>
